# Dealing with the remaining pile of typos:
# * Mark valid mechanistic transliterations as IT and TT; these would
#   not be eligible for Wiktionary.  (Will reduce R and T4+.)
#   Probably want to make a separate step that runs at download time
#   that makes a file of transliterated forms for spell.py to load.
#    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_romanizations
#    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization
# * Refine "N" category:
#   * Valid word + hyphen + invalid word - probably a typo especially
#     if the invalid one is T1.  Maybe classify both sides?
#   * Chemistry words with hypens
#   * Chemistry words with hypens and numbers
#   * Other words with numbers (need to manually {{not a typo}})
#   * Remainders (sounding outs, non-English words?)

# * Refine "I" category to distinguish between human-language words
#   (IW) and scientific notation and other characters (IS).  spell.py
#   should generally be enhanced to ignore IS that complies with the
#   Manual of Style.
# * Post lists of words in other Wiktionaries missing from the English
#   Wiktionary (W)
# * Look at IW words and see what's left
#   * May need to separate IW into those that are and aren't 1 edit
#     away from a non-English word, and post IWT1 probable
#     misspellings, non-English
#   * May need to replace ispell hack for English, anyway?
#   * Post IW probable new words, non-English
#   * R and T4+ mixed in article with IW or IT are probably
#     non-English; include these in lists, and update stats.
# * Some legit English T1s are marked as W or TT, recover those and
#   post a list for people to sort them out.  Might help to have an
#   English-only spell check list.
# * Post lists of valid but untagged transliterations (IT) by script
# * Post lists of in-Wiktionary but untagged words by language, so
#   people interested in those languages can go tag the English
#   articles (need to add language classifier)
# Also helps stats a lot:
# * Tagging articles for {{cleanup HTML}} from the appropriate report
# * Tagging articles with the most misspelled words with:
#   {{cleanup |reason=Need to use {{tl|lang}} to tag non-English words for consistent formatting, screen readers, and automated spell checkers}}
#   (probably the top 3000 or so articles with the most misspellings,
#   down to about 20 or so, though there are many mixed in at lower
#   frequencies)
